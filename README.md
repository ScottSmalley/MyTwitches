# MyTwitches
ABOUT:
Chrome extension used for Twitch.tv chatrooms. 
It allows a user to filter the chat for specific phrases or 
symbols into a separate chat area.
NOTE: The current version does not allow for filtering of 
Emotes, including BTTV emotes. 

SETUP:
Download and unzip the project folder.
Place the inner folder anywhere you'd like to keep it for storage.
Launch Google Chrome.
In the top right corner, click on the 3 vertical dots.
Under "More Tools," click "Extensions"
A new tab will open with your extensions page.
At the top right of the page, there's a slider called "Developer 
Mode" that needs to be enabled.
At the top left of the page, click on "Load unpacked."
Navigate to the inner folder.
Now the folder name should show up as an Extension.
Make sure it's enabled (slider is blue).
Now navigate to any Twitch stream. 
  (Note: Twitch doesn't fully refresh the page if you navigate 
  through multiple twitch pages. 
  You'll need to manually refresh the page for the extension to 
  work.)
 In the top right of your Google Chrome browser, there should 
 be a puzzle piece icon.
 Click it and click the pin icon to pin it to your Chrome Browser.
 You'll see a purple icon next to the puzzle piece icon with the
 letters "MT" on it.
 This is the extension.
 After the page is loaded, click the "MT" icon and enter the phrase 
 you want to search for.
 Click "START" and it will create our custom chat window just below 
 the Notifications area of
 the Twitch Chat window. 
 Click "STOP" to stop searching and close the MyTwitches chat window.
 The "Clear" button in the chat window will clear the chat.
